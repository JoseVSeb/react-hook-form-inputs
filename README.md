## About this project

This project simplifies the use of [`react-hook-form`](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form)
with component libraries such as [`MUI`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).
It provides extensions to input controller from `react-hook-form`
for inputs from component libraries,
which can be used to pass type-safe props between controller and the inputs.
